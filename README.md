# Better Paths
A better map highlighting mod for Slay the Spire

### Current features (WIP)
* Right click nodes to toggle highlighting; they will use the currently selected color
* SHIFT+right click nodes to toggle all "forced" nodes (i.e. nodes that you *must* path through to get to the one right clicked on)
* Clear button (no more needing to manually unset all existing path highlights)
* Legend quick access - right click the legend items on the right of the map screen to quickly toggle all nodes of that particular type (e.g. fast access to highlighting all elites in an act)
* ALT+right click nodes to show an "X" through them -- marking paths as too dangerous to follow or not takeable in the current run. (You'll still be able to path there, but this will hopefully prevent you from mindlessly clicking on an act 3 path that doesn't go through the super elite) -- *NOTE: also works with SHIFT modifier!*

### Current buggy features (WIP)
* A checkbox to show / hide highlights for floors beneath the current one. This option is not yet finished, but is mostly useable. (It's a bit buggy in some cases)

### Important WARNING
This is an alpha build - use at your own risk! I believe there might be an issue with Act 4 (as it has a different generation technique than the other acts) which can cause a game crash. It happened to me once, but I wasn't able to replicate it through future testing. I believe a crash here won't corrupt your save, but will require a game restart. If it continues to crash on future boots, you'll have to remove the mod temporarily for the final act (sorry!). Please [let me know](https://github.com/casey-c/sts_betterpaths/issues) if you run into this issue so I can confirm if it exists!
